TODO list
Musts:
    Take a look at the ghost behaviour again. There seems to be a crash, when it changes from dead to random, sometimes.
    Remove the random buttons, or add functionality to them
    Debug knap (bare brug "Button")
    Try to make an open area in the maze.

Nice to have:
    Take a look the BiDirectional script again. Check the todo.
    Fix the movement, so you don't stop when moving into a wall, but continue along the previous direction.
    Organize stuff neatly in packages..
    Check for unused code
    Optimization
