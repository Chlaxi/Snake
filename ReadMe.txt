This is the exam project for the Essential Computing 2 course at Roskilde University.
We had to use Java Fx to make Snake. So we had to design the gamefield, make the input-controls, make four different pathfinding algorithms (A*, Bi-Directional, Breadth First, and Best First), one for each ghost.

We were provided with a template for the Fx part by our teacher (which also explains the functionless buttons), since the foxus of the assignment was on the pathfinding algorithms.

---Controls---
WASD or arrow keys for movement.
